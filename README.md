# Physics simulations in Julia

This repository contains simulations of several well-known physical systems. It's intended to serve as an instructive sandbox for these classical systems and the [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/OrdinaryDiffEq/stable/) package.

## Available simulations

- Free-falling object in a constant gravitational field
- Simple pendulum (simple harmonic oscillator)
- Driven harmonic oscillator

## License

The code is available under the permissive [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).
