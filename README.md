# Physics simulations in Julia

This repository contains simulations of several well-known physical systems. It's intended to serve as an instructive sandbox for these classical systems and for the [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/OrdinaryDiffEq/stable/) and [ModellingToolkit.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/) packages.

## Available simulations

These are all presented in detalied [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which can be found in the [`notebooks`](notebooks) directory:

- Free-falling object in a constant gravitational field
- Simple pendulum (simple harmonic oscillator)
- Driven harmonic oscillator
- Transport equation
- Waves (based on the wave equation)

## License

The code is available under the permissive [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).
